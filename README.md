# ERP---Attendance-System
Our MERN stack Attendance Management System streamlines attendance tracking for educational institutions. Teachers can mark attendance securely by subject and branch, while students have real-time access to their attendance records displayed in user-friendly pie charts.

This Attendance Management System is a comprehensive solution built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, allowing educational institutions to seamlessly manage attendance records. The application is designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, offering a single-page application (SPA) experience developed in React and integrated with Redux Toolkit for state management.

Key Features:

Teacher-centric Attendance Marking:

Only authorized teachers have the privilege to mark attendance for the specific subjects they teach to a particular branch. This ensures accuracy and accountability in attendance tracking.
Student Access:

Students can easily access the portal to view their daily attendance records. The system provides a user-friendly interface for students to stay informed about their attendance status.
Interactive Pie Charts:

Attendance data is presented in a visually appealing pie chart format, allowing users to quickly grasp attendance trends. The intuitive representation aids both teachers and students in understanding attendance patterns at a glance.
Token-based Authentication:

Security is a top priority, and the system employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can access the attendance portal.
Efficient Redux State Management:

Redux Toolkit is utilized for efficient state management, enabling seamless communication between React components. This ensures a smooth and responsive user experience.
